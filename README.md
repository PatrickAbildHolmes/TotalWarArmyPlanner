## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is twofold:
* To provide a tool for the Total War community, SP and MP, to plan and share army compositions
* Personal experience with web development in a new language (Go)

## Other useful information
This project relies on large amounts of unit information and pictures from the game pack files, 
which are periodically retrieved through the use of a tool and inserted into the database.
